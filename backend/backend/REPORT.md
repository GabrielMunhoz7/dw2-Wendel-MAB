# Project Report

## Development Process
This project was developed to create a RESTful API using FastAPI/Flask with an SQLite database. The development process involved several stages, including planning, implementation, testing, and deployment.

## Challenges Faced
1. **Database Configuration**: Setting up the SQLite database required careful consideration of the schema and data models.
2. **API Design**: Designing a RESTful API that adheres to best practices while ensuring it meets the project requirements was challenging.
3. **Error Handling**: Implementing proper error handling to return appropriate status codes for various scenarios was crucial.

## Solutions Implemented
1. **Database Connection**: Utilized SQLAlchemy for ORM mapping to simplify database interactions.
2. **API Endpoints**: Created clear and concise API endpoints that return JSON responses with the correct status codes.
3. **Testing**: Implemented unit tests to ensure the functionality of the API and database interactions.

## Conclusion
The project successfully meets the requirements and provides a solid foundation for further development and enhancements. Future work may include adding authentication, improving error handling, and expanding the API functionality.
