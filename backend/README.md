# Backend Project

This project is a backend application built using FastAPI or Flask, designed to provide a RESTful API that returns JSON responses. It utilizes SQLite as the database for data storage.

## Project Structure

- **app.py**: Entry point of the application. Initializes the FastAPI or Flask app and sets up the routes for the RESTful API.
- **models.py**: Defines the data models used in the application, including ORM mappings for the SQLite database.
- **database.py**: Handles the database connection and configuration, including setup for SQLite.
- **seed.py**: Contains scripts to seed the database with initial data.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the dependencies required for the project.
- **REPORT.md**: Used for project reporting, detailing the development process, challenges faced, and solutions implemented.
- **app.db**: SQLite database file where the application's data is stored.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```

   2. Install dependencies

   ```
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   3. Seed database (run once)

   ```
   python seed.py
   ```

   4. Run server

   ```
   uvicorn app:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
